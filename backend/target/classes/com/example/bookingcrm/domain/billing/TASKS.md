# Billing Domain Tasks

This folder contains domain types for the **billing** context.

- Add entity classes, enums, and value objects related to `billing`.
- Keep these classes free of Spring annotations.
- Implement core business rules (methods that enforce invariants).

Refer to `docs/SCHEMA.md` for initial fields and relationships.
